# A series of numbers in which each number (Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. 
# The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.
# Write a method that does the Fibonacci sequence starting at 1

# 1 + 1 = 2
# 1 + 2 = 3
# 2 + 3 = 5
# 3 + 5 = 8

for num in range(1,9):
    
    sum = num1 + num2
